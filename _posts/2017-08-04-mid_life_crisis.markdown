### This past fall I broke one wrist and sprained my other.  This led me to exam my life.  I am an artist who has a day job as a freelance bookkeeper.  

### As I was reflecting I started writing (OK not writing because I could not) and thinking about my life.  I came p with list of things that I liked to do.  What was on each of the list was problem solving.  It is how I approached life.  The other was I liked organizing things.  On reflection I had liked the database work I had done in the past and some of the programing.  I had just not concentrated on these areas to become an expert.  I figure no time like the present. Hence I am here.
